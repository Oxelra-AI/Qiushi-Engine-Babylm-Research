## Bridge-sign paired comparisons

## Scientific reading

If the tied model shows graph_same_margin and graph_mean_de reversing between bs+1 and bs-1 while hh_closure and seen references remain stable, this is evidence for absolute gauge transport through the shared coordinate.  shared_trunk and untied models should not show the same coherent reversal.  anchor-only and comparison-only cells provide the factorial interaction.
